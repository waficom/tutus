Thanks for all the hard word you are making for this project.

##A little bit of history of GaiaEHR:
At first we forked OpenEMR and then tried to adapt Sencha ExtJS to OpenEMR, Sencha ExtJS 
been a UI framework to speed up development of the project, but the time passed and we 
decided to make ourselves a community driven EHR where everyone can contribute and share 
ideas, well that’s how it got started, very simple motivation indeed. 

Launching our BETA release  is a big step forward to the medical industry innovation, 
taking the Open Source ideal as our guide.
